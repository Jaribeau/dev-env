# dev-env
A place to keep my dev environment preferences and setups to unify the experience across devices.

## Intro
If it's worth it I'll put that which can easily be scripted into a script. For now I just want to compile the must-have pieces of my setup.


### New Machine Setup (Linux)
Terminal of choice:  
`sudo apt install terminator`  

Custom Aliases:  
```
 touch ~/.bash_aliases  `
 printf "\nalias st=\"status\"\n" >> ~/.bash_aliases 
 printf "\nsource ~/.bash_aliases\n" >> ~/.bashrc
```
